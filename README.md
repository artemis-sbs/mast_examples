# Mast examples

These are examples of the MAST scripting language.

MAST is a interpreted scripting language built in python for use in Artemis Cosmos.

MAST is part of the sbs_utils library which adds a set of reusable components to help enable Artemis Cosmos scripters more productive.

It is being documented here:

https://artemis-sbs.github.io/sbs_utils/mastsyntax.html

With a general tutorial here:

https://artemis-sbs.github.io/sbs_utils/tutorials/mast.html

To change which example is run change the story_file in script.py

This is a work in progress syntax and functionality may change over time.

MAST is included in sbs_utils. A community driven library and contribution and feedback is welcomed.
